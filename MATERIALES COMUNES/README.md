## Introduction

In this lesson, we will introduce four of the most commonly used materials that you will encounter when working with Three.js. Understanding these materials will help you make informed decisions about which one to use in various scenarios.

## Materials Covered

- **MeshBasicMaterial**: A material for drawing geometries in a simple shaded (flat or wireframe) way.
- **MeshNormalMaterial**: A material that maps the normal vectors of the geometry to RGB colors.
- **MeshPhongMaterial**: A shiny material with specular highlights, useful for simulating shiny surfaces.
- **MeshStandardMaterial**: A physically-based material with roughness and metalness properties, used for more realistic rendering.
